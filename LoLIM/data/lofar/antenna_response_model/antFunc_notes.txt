The NPY files are various versions of the AARTFAAC model average across LBA-outer of the superterp


AARTFAAC_AVE_LBAOUTER_R700_C17
	This was used for awhile, however it has C=17e-15 F, when it should be C=17e-12 F. It is only kept for historical reasons
	
AARTFAAC_AVE_LBAOUTER_R700C15pF
	This is the AARTFAAC model with C = 15e-12 F. This is the 'empircal' LNA values reference in teh AARTFAAC beam model paper.
	This is used by LOFLI
	
AARTFAAC_AVE_LBAOUTER_R700C17pF
	This has C = 17e-12 F, which may be slightly more accurate than  C = 15e-12 F. This is now the default for LOLIM
